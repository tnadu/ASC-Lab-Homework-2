# Arhitectura Sistemelor de Calcul (Computer Architecture) - Lab Homework 2
The problem statement implies using a recursive backtracking algorithm to fill out all null
positions of a given array of size 3*n with numbers between 1 and n, such that each number
can only be used 3 times, with a minimum distance of m between equal elements. Non-null
elements in the given array cannot be modified and the resulting filled-out array must be
the smallest lexicographical permutation of set {1, ..., n}. The solution will be written
in Assembly x86, using the AT&T syntax.
